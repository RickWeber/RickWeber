### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rick!

I like to build things with 1s and 0s. My Github page is where I keep most of these things. Lately I've been focusing on building my Python skills by learning Django, but in the past I've done lots with R and NetLogo. 

You can also find me solving puzzles at [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/RickWeber). ![My Codewards profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/RickWeber/badges/small)
