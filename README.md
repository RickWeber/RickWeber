### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rick!

I like to build things with 1s and 0s. My Github page is where I keep most of these things.

You can find more details at [my website](www.hirerick.com) or [my linkedin](www.hirerick.com/linkedin). 

You can also find me solving puzzles at [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/RickWeber). ![My Codewards profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/RickWeber/badges/small)
